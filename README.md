# Project Objective:
This project aims to analyse sparkify user event data and build a model to predict which user has high probability to cancel the service. This can help the company to avoid user cancellation through providing discounts before cancellation.

# Files in the repository:

- Mini_sparkify_event_data.json
   A subset of sparkify_event_data which record user information and activities
- Sparkify.ipynb
   This file explore, analysis the sparkify_event_data and build a user cancellation prediction model
  


# Results Summary and analysis:

By comparing the F1 score and accuracy, I found logistic regression algorithm had the best performance.
